Studies have indicated that people tend to remember images more effectively than text, and traditional text passwords are susceptible to hacking. By allowing users to select specific images and grid points to use as their graphical passwords, this system aims to provide a higher level of security compared to standard text passwords. This project was developed using HTML, PHP, JavaScript, JQuery, CSS and MySQL." },
